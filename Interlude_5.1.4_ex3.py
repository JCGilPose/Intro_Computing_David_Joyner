#Previously, you wrote a class called ExerciseSession that
#had three attributes: an exercise name, an intensity, and a
#duration.
#
#Add a new method to that class called calories_burned.
#calories_burned should have no parameters (besides self, as
#every method in a class has). It should return an integer
#representing the number of calories burned according to the
#following formula:
#
# - If the intensity is "Low", 4 calories are burned per
#   minute.
# - If the intensity is "Moderate", 8 calories are burned
#   per minute.
# - If the intensity is "High", 12 calories are burned per
#   minute.
#
#You may copy your class from the previous exercise and just
#add to it.


#Add your code here!
