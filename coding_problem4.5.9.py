#Recall last exercise that you wrote a function, word_lengths,
#which took in a string and returned a dictionary where each
#word of the string was mapped to an integer value of how
#long it was.
#
#This time, write a new function called length_words so that
#the returned dictionary maps an integer, the length of a
#word, to a list of words from the sentence with that length.
#If a word occurs more than once, add it more than once. The
#words in the list should appear in the same order in which
#they appeared in the sentence.
#
#For example:
#
#  length_words("I ate a bowl of cereal out of a dog bowl today.")
#  -> {3: ['ate', 'dog', 'out'], 1: ['a', 'a', 'i'],
#      5: ['today'], 2: ['of', 'of'], 4: ['bowl'], 6: ['cereal']}
#
#As before, you should remove any punctuation and make the
#string lowercase.

#Write your function here!
def length_words(string):
    lengths = {}
    string = string.lower()
    to_replace = ".,'!?"
    for mark in to_replace:
        string = string.replace(mark, "")
    words = string.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) not in lengths:
            lengths[len(word)] = [word]
        else:
            lengths[len(word)].append(word)
    return lengths


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print:
#{1: ['i', 'a', 'a'], 2: ['of', 'of'], 3: ['ate', 'out', 'dog'], 4: ['bowl', 'bowl'], 5: ['today'], 6: ['cereal']}
#
#The keys may appear in a different order, but within each
#list the words should appear in the order shown above.
