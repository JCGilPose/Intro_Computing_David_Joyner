#Recall in coding problem 4.4.3 that you wrote a function
#called "reader" that read a .cs1301 file and returned a
#list of lists.
#
#Let's revise that problem. Instead of a list of lists,
#that's return a dictionary of dictionaries.
#
#Write a function called "reader" that takes one parameter,
#a filename as a string corresponding to a .cs1301 file,
#and reads in that .cs1301 file.
#
#Each line of the .cs1301 file will have five items, each
#separated by a space: the first, third, and fourth will
#represent integers, the second will be a string, and the
#fifth will represent a float. (Note: when reading the
#file, these will all be strings; you can assume each of
#these strings can be converted to the corresponding data
#type, however.)
#
#The function should return a dictionary of dictionaries
#representing the file contents.
#
#The keys of the top-level dictionary should be the
#assignment names. Then, the value for each of those keys
#should be a dictionary with four keys: "number", "grade",
#"total", and "weight". The values corresponding to each of
#those four keys should be the values from the file,
#converted to the corresponding data types (ints or floats).
#
#For example, if the input file read:
#
# 1 exam_1 90 100 0.6
# 2 exam_2 95 100 0.4
#
#Then reader would return this dictionary of dictionaries:
#
# {"exam_1": {"number": 1, "grade": 90, "total": 100, "weight": 0.6},
#  "exam_2": {"number": 2, "grade": 95, "total": 100, "weight": 0.4}}
#
#Write your function here!
def reader(filename):
    data = open(filename, 'r')
    exams = {}
    for line in data:
        line = line.split()
        exam = {}
        exam["number"] = int(line[0])
        exam["grade"] = int(line[2])
        exam["total"] = int(line[3])
        exam["weight"] = float(line[4])
        exams[line[1]] = exam
    data.close()
    return exams
